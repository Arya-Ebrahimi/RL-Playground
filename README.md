## RL Playground
Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning playground. I will put the codes and exercises I do while learning RL here.

##### Table of Contents
- [Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://github.com/Arya-Ebrahimi/RL-Playground/tree/main/Coursera-Reinforcement-Learning-Specialization " Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialization") : My solutions for the Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialization.
- [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/Arya-Ebrahimi/RL-Playground/tree/main/Dynamic_Programming " Dynamic Programming") : Policy and Value iteration algorithms are implemented and tested on two Gym environments.
- [Monte Carlo](https://github.com/Arya-Ebrahimi/RL-Playground/tree/main/Monte_Carlo " Monte Carlo") : Monte Carlo prediction and control for Blackjack.
-[Deep Q-Learning](https://github.com/Arya-Ebrahimi/RL-Playground/tree/master/Deep-Q-Learning " DQN") : DQN implementation using pytorch, I used the pytorch documentation in RL section but for a different environment. It currently has some bugs.
